%In this demo, you can replay learned movement; then you can begin a movement with the geomagic on iCubGazeboSim. To that, you will use a Cpp program that records your movement as long as you press a Geomagic button. Then, this script retrieve these early observation, and infer the movement end. It replays it on the icubGazeboSim.
